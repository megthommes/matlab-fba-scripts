# matlab-scripts

Collection of MATLAB files used in my research projects while working as a PhD student with [Daniel Segre](https://www.bu.edu/segrelab/) at Boston University.

# Folders
I separated scripts based on their usage.

## CMDA
Thse are the preliminary scripts used in my paper ("Designing Metabolic Division of Labor in Microbial Communities")[https://msystems.asm.org/content/4/2/e00263-18/article-info]. The finalized scripts can be found in the [segrelab/dolmn](https://github.com/segrelab/dolmn) repository.

## COBRA
I edited some of the [COBRA](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/) toolbox functions for my own purposes.

## COMETS
[COMETS](http://www.bu.edu/segrelab/comets/), or **C**omputation **o**f **M**icrobial **E**cosystems in **T**ime and **S**pace, is a software developed by the Segre lab. Some of these scripts were incorporated into the [COMETS Toolbox](http://www.bu.edu/segrelab/comets/), which enables users to work with COMETS from within MATLAB.

## FBA
These are a collection of functions that I used to run and analyze **F**lux **B**alance **A**nalysis (FBA).

## Misc
As the name implies, this is a collection of miscellaneous files.

## linear-regression
These are the scripts I developed to learn how to implement linear regression using linear programming.
